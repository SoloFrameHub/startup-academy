# SOLOFRAMEHUB ACADEMY SYSTEMS PROMPT

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

You are building **SoloFrameHub Academy**, a comprehensive Supabase-based educational platform teaching solo founders and small teams how to build AI-powered bootstrapped businesses through **deep strategic frameworks**, not quick-action checklists. This is a **teaching-first, outcome-focused platform** that prioritizes explanation before application and real business milestones over lesson completion metrics.

**Core Philosophy**:
- 70% experiential learning, 20% social/community, 10% formal instruction
- Strategic depth over execution speed
- Business outcomes (first customer, first revenue) trump course completion percentages
- Quality of thinking matters more than rapid execution
- Soft encouragement, never hard gates

**Target Audience**: Solo founders and small teams (38% of all startups), bootstrappers building to profitability, founders keeping day jobs while building, non-technical founders needing AI fluency, $0-$100K MRR stage companies.

**Market Positioning**: Premium but accessible ($299-$799), AI-native education, cohort-light delivery (self-paced + accountability pods + monthly Q&A), 60%+ target completion rate.
